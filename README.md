# Dotfiles

## What?
* Small shell enhancements to make your terminal attractive!
* Works with ```zsh, bash```.

## Install
```
$ chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh # Run as sudo
```

## Catches
* Dependency installation handled only for Debian and its downstream distros. Install missing packages if you run a different OS.
* The dotconfigs also have 3rd party tools buillt-in like [Bit.ly]() and [Pushbullet](). If you'd like to use them, you also need to configure access keys with names ```ACCESS_TOKEN``` and ```PUSH_BULLET_ACCESS_TOKEN``` in your ```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc``` file, in accordance with whatever shell you use.
